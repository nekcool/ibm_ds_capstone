SpaceX Assessment Project

Use data science approach to assess Falcon 9 rocket success rate

  Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million dollars vs others at $165 million dollars each
  Much of the savings is due to SpaceX can reuse the first stage for landing
  Use API to collect historical data, conduct web scraping, data wrangling, compile SQL queries, develop EDA visualization, generate plotly dashboard, leverage 4 machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Regression Tree, KNN), and evaluate the chance of such success
  The objective is to provide business insights for future bids on such project against SpaceX
  
Summary of all results

  Overall Falcon 9 success rate is about 67%, with KSC LC-39A and VAFB SLC 4E sites at 77%
  With heavy payloads, Polar, LEO and ISS Orbits have higher successful landing rate
  Among 4 models, Regression Tree model delivers the best accuracy at 89% (based on test data)
